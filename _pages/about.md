I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Calgary](https://science.ucalgary.ca/computer-science). I have done my master's in the field of Artificial intelligence under the supervision of Dr. Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghadam from Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran Iran. Now I am a computer graphic Ph.D. candidate at the University of Calgary under the supervision of [Dr. Faramarz Samavati](https://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~samavati/) and [Dr. Sonny Chan](https://vt2.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/). My work mostly focuses on 3D printing and making interactive 3D printed projects. We mostly work on Medical images datasets and heritage datasets. I am also working as data science and machine-learning instructor in different companies and Bootcamp including, [RoboGarden](https://robogarden.ca/), [CodeKevudah](https://www.codekevudah.org/) and [Adalegit](https://adalegit.com/).
I also got the Best Teaching Assistance award and assign as TA in Residence at the University of Calgary.



## Research Interest

I am interested in developing a machine learning algorithm for segmenting medical images. I am also interested in (Human-Computer Interaction) HCI application in making 3D printed objects interactive.

In my spare time, I prepare courses for data Science Bootcamps and I improve my Virtual Reality skills.
